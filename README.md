# MarioTetris
Tetris clone made in python using pyglet package. Used for general python practice

## Controls for this game are simple:

- left and right arrow keys move left and right
- up and down arrow keys rotate clockwise/anticlockwise
- spacebar will hard drop your piece
- D key will soft drop your piece
- Left shift will hold current piece

## Implemented stuff:

- Wall kicks off walls/floor/stack
- sounds(kinda)
- simple high score tracking using SQLite
- rudimentary menus
- rudimentary scoring system

## To implement:
- Scoring for combos/tspins/drops
- music
- better menus with actual buttons/sliders
- names in high scores

Code works with no known bugs, however it is not the cleanest implementation. Feel free to play with the code or use in other projects.

The zip file contains an executable of the game. Just unzip the folder and run main.exe
